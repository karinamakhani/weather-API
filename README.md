# weather-API
Connect to one of these free weather APIs -- https://rapidapi.com/blog/access-global-weather-data-with-these-weather-apis/
Start with the goal of just getting the current weather data and then rendering the temperature on the screen. After that can stop or just play around with it.

Tech/framework used
On VSCode just use typescript (.ts), typescript is basically javascript but better. Documentation: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/
